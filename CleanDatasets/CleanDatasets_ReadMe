This folder includes all the clean datasets created for the Datavision project.
An important consideration is that time constraints did not allow our team to create complete data for each year. 
Final prediction datasets going two years in the past have been created to illustrate how this type of dataset would look across editions of the contest.
To illustrate how the data for a year would work, we have included datasets for top 10 predictions by juries and clubs in Eurovoix's Eurojury and clubs in the OGAE Poll.
Please note that other organizations, and their rankings, could and would be included as long as the policies established in the documentation are followed.
